Improving Heunâ€™s method for the numerical simulation of SDEs with additive noise

The script improved_heun.py runs a simple numerical experiment for the Euler-Maruyama, Heun and improved Heun methods on the SDE:

dy_t = sin(y_t) dt + sigma dW_t.


The numerical methods and example are outlined in the document heun_presentation.pdf.
